Sorry for holding back on y'all during Week 1! We were getting everything together and there wasn't a lot of movement at first, but things have really started to pick up.

The Everybot reveal dropped this past Tuesday, giving us a ton of ideas and a clear sense of direction for our build strategy. For those unfamiliar, the Everybot is a simple, competitive robot design that teams can reference when planning their own builds.

## Week 1 Progress

Last week we built one of the **BUMPS** from the game field and tested it with our tank drive practice bot that we use during the offseason. The drivers looked excited to catch some air!

Testing field elements early helps us understand the physical challenges and fine-tune our robot design before we commit to building the competition bot.

## Week 2 Challenges

This week will not be as productive as Texas is experiencing a winter storm, so we're taking safety precautions and limiting in-person sessions.

Hopefully Week 3 will be much more productive so we can give y'all some exciting updates!

Stay safe out there, and we'll be back stronger next week.
