<p>We are excited to share this incredible moment with everyone! Today we attended the <strong>2026 FIRST® Robotics Competition Kickoff</strong> and learned about this year's game: <strong>REBUILT™</strong>, presented by Haas. A huge shoutout to the <strong>Lufkin Pantherbots (Team 2582)</strong> for their amazing hospitality in hosting us at the kickoff event!</p>
<p>This year's challenge centers around scoring Fuel in alternating active Hubs and climbing Towers for bonus points. The unique Hub activation system and multiple Ranking Point thresholds are going to make strategy crucial.</p>
<h2>Our Game Plan</h2>
<p>After watching the reveal, we're ready to start brainstorming! Here's our initial thinking:</p>
<p><strong>Tank Drive</strong> - We're focusing on a tank drive system this year for better control when navigating the field's Bumps and Trenches.</p>
<p><strong>Climbing</strong> - With up to 30 points available for reaching Level 3, climbing is non-negotiable. We're designing for at least Level 2 capability.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel Management</strong> - The alternating Hub system means we need smart autonomous routines and precise timing during our active windows to hit those Energized and Supercharged thresholds.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We're ready to start the build season strong! The team will be meeting this week to develop detailed CAD designs, finalize our strategy, and start prototyping key mechanisms. Let's make this year unforgettable!</p>
