<p>Sorry for holding back on y'all during Week 1! We were getting everything together and there wasn't a lot of movement at first, but things have really started to pick up.</p>
<p>The Everybot reveal dropped this past Tuesday, giving us a ton of ideas and a clear sense of direction for our build strategy. For those unfamiliar, the Everybot is a simple, competitive robot design that teams can reference when planning their own builds.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Week 1 Progress</h2>
<p>Last week we built one of the <strong>BUMPS</strong> from the game field and tested it with our tank drive practice bot that we use during the offseason. The drivers looked excited to catch some air!</p>
<p>Testing field elements early helps us understand the physical challenges and fine-tune our robot design before we commit to building the competition bot.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Week 2 Challenges</h2>
<p>This week will not be as productive as Texas is experiencing a winter storm, so we're taking safety precautions and limiting in-person sessions.</p>
<p>Hopefully Week 3 will be much more productive so we can give y'all some exciting updates!</p>
<p>Stay safe out there, and we'll be back stronger next week.</p>
