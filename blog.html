          Today we started building our robot for the <em>Crescendo</em> challenge. It's a lot of hard work, but our team spirit is high and we're ready for the challenge ahead. The machine shop is buzzing with activity as students learn welding, machining, and assembly techniques from our mentors. Progress is steady!
