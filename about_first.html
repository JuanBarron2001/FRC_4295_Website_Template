        Combining the excitement of sport with the rigor of science and technology, FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) challenges high school students to design, build, and program industrial-size robots to compete in a new game each year. Students call it <span class="text-tech font-bold">"the hardest fun you'll ever have."</span>
