  <p class="text-center">
    Combining the excitement of sport with the rigor of science and technology, FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) challenges high school students to design, build, and program industrial-size robots to compete in a new game each year. Students call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Under strict rules, limited time, and limited resources, teams raise funds, design a team brand, hone teamwork skills, and build robots to compete against like-minded teams. Volunteer professional mentors guide students, making FRC as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Each season culminates in the thrilling FIRST Championship.
