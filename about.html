            It is no secret that the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields are increasingly plagued with a lack of people. Even though they are the fastest growing industries in the world, so few are willing to pursue them. Why? The most likely answer is that there is a lack of enthusiasm in these subjects. Hudson Stingers Robotics is ready to change this.

            Hudson Stingers Robotics (Team 4295) is a twelve-year-old team representing FIRST (For Inspiration of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition (FRC). FIRST is a globally recognized high-school organization which, therefore, has worldwide participation. Each year FIRST releases a game in which teams must build a robot to carry out a certain task. The “build season” spans a period of six weeks. Once the competition starts, teams must work with, or against, each other in alliances to win the game.

            Since our team was founded in 2012, we have seen a massive increase in both team members and mentors, and we improve each year, with increased global ranking in competitions. We attribute this to the intensive hands-on learning that our team provides. To be successful in the game, students must have a firm grasp of engineering, programming, and project management along with marketing and business skills. Not only does this program give scholarly advancement, but it teaches life skills such as ingenuity, responsibility, and resourcefulness.
