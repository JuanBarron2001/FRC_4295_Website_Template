        Founded in 2012, Hudson Stingers Robotics (FRC Team 4295) has proudly represented Hudson High School for over a decade. Each year, we take on the challenge of the 
        <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>, where students design, build, and program a robot in just six weeks to compete in alliance-based games.

        Since our founding, we’ve grown in both student members and mentors, improving our global competition rankings each year. Our success comes from intensive hands-on learning in engineering, programming, CAD, project management, and business skills. Beyond technical expertise, our students gain life skills such as ingenuity, responsibility, and resourcefulness.
